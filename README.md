# DriverIQ: Personalized Road Safety & Introspection Platform

> **Empowering every driver to shift from risk to safety through data-driven self-reflection and measurable insights.**

### 1. The Mission: Why DriverIQ?

Traditional road safety measures often treat driving as an external regulatory problem. **DriverIQ** flips this approach by providing a powerful, personalized tool for **self-introspection**.

We translate complex telematics data into simple, actionable metrics that reveal *why* a driver is risky or safe. By giving drivers a clear, objective **mirror** of their own habits, we motivate a continuous cycle of learning, better decision-making, and proactive improvement—making the driver the chief agent of road safety.

### 2. Key Features

(Name) provides the tools necessary to analyze behavior and chart a path to safer driving:

* **Personalized Risk Score:** An objective, calculated metric that quantifies the risk level of a driver based on recent activity (Lower score = Safer).
* **Behavioral Deep Dive:** Visualize frequency and severity of specific risky events (e.g., harsh braking, rapid acceleration, speeding duration) with contextual maps and timestamps.
* **The Safety Loop Trend Tracker:** Graphically monitors improvement (or regression) over time, showing the long-term impact of behavioral changes.
* **Introspection Guides:** Provides focused summaries (e.g., "90% of your speeding occurs on Monday mornings") to guide the driver's self-reflection and decision-making.
* **Metric Definitions:** Clear, simple explanations of how each safety metric is calculated, ensuring full transparency.
